# Link
Links are the defining feature of the web
because they allow you to move from
one web page to another — enabling the
very idea of browsing or surfing.

# Directory Structure
On larger websites it's a good idea to organize your code by placing the
pages for each different section of the site into a new folder. Folders on a
website are sometimes referred to as directories.
- **Structure**
The diagram on the right shows
the directory structure for a
fictional entertainment listings
website called ExampleArts.
The top-level folder is known
as the root folder. (In this
example, the root folder is called
examplearts.) The root folder
contains all of the other files and
folders for a website.
- **Relationships**
The relationship between
files and folders on a website
is described using the same
terminology as a family tree.
- **Homepages**
The main homepage of a site
written in HTML (and the
homepages of each section in a
child folder) is called index.html.
Web servers are usually set up
to return the index.html file if no
file name is specified.

# Rela tive UR Ls
Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own
website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to
find your files.

# Email Links
**mailto**: email-links.html HTML
To create a link that starts up
the user's email program and
addresses an email to a specified
email address, you use the <a>
element. However, this time the
value of the href attribute starts
with mailto: and is followed by
the email address you want the
email to be sent to.
# Layout
In this chapter we are going to look at
how to control where each element sits
on a page and how to create attractive
page layouts.
- **Building Blocks**
CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.
- **Containing Elements**
If one block-level element sits inside another
block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element.
# Screen Sizes
Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show
different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to
work on a range of different sized screens.
# Layout Grids
Composition in any visual art (such as design, painting, or photography)
is the placement or arrangement of visual elements — how they are
organized on a page. Many designers use a grid structure to help them
position items on a page, and the same is true for web designers.

# Functions & methods & objects
Browsers require very detailed instructions about what
we want them to do. Therefore, complex scripts can run
to hundreds (even thousands) of lines. Programmers use
functions, methods, and objects to organize their code.
This chapter is divided into three sections that introduce.

# 6 Reasons for Pair Programming
**Why pair program?**
While learning to code, developers likely study several programming languages. Similar to a foreign language class, there are four fundamental skills that help anyone learn a new language: Listening: hearing and interpreting the vocabulary Speaking: using the correct words to communicate an idea Reading: understanding what written language intends to convey Writing: producing from scratch a meaningful.
