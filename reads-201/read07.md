# Domain Modeling
Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain. An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.

A domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate the understanding of a specific problem among various stakeholders. As a communication tool, it defines a vocabulary that can be used within and between both technical and business teams.

XX What information suits tables
#### What's a Table?
A table represents information in a grid format.
Examples of tables include financial reports, TV
schedules, and sports results.
# CREATING OBJECTS USING CONSTRUCTOR SYNTAX
On the right, an empty object
called hote 1 is created using the
constructor function.
Once it has been created, three
properties and a method are
then assigned to the object.
( If the object already had any
of these properties, this would
overwrite the values in those
properties.)
## RECAP: WAYS TO CREATE OBJECTS
CREATE THE OBJECT, THEN ADD PROPERTIES & METHODS
In both of these examples, the object is created on
the first line of the code sample. The properties and
methods are then added to it afterwards.Once you have created an object, the syntax for adding or removing any properties and methods
from that object is the same.
## RECAP: STORING DATA
In JavaScript, data is represented using name/value pairs.
To organize your data, you can use an array or object to group a set of
related values. In arrays and objects the name is also known as a key.

## GLOBAL OBJECTS: MATH OBJECT
The Math object has properties and methods
for mathematical constants and functions.
